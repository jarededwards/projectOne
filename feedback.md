 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.** Everything is working as it should, but I think you could've pushed yourself further here with additional functionality. For example, should not be able to pick a letter more than once, show a hangman figuring, set messages when the letter is wrong.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** You have a fair bit of non-working code in there. I wouldn't have that on a master branch. Consider, in the future, creating feature branches and not merging until you achieve functionality.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** You have some responsiveness in your layout, so that's definitely cool. But, if your game is hangman, you should have a hangman figurine.
